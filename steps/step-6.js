/**
 * STEP #6 - Authorization - database and storage
 * ========
 * NOTES:
 * You don't need to implement any js code here.
 * You should create two authorization files:
 * 1) database-rules.json (https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/) > Update the rules to the following which only allows authenticated users to read and write
 * 2) storage.rules (https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/start) > Update the rules to the following which only allows users to write to their own folder
