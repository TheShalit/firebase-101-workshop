/**
 * STEP #6 - Hosting - deploy your webapp to production (CDN)
 * ========
 * THIS STEP REQUIRES NO JAVASCRIPT CODE (don't write anything in this file).
 *
 * In this step you will deploy your app to firebase hosting and make it public to everyone.
 *
 * 1) Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/).
 * 2) In cmd/terminal enter `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
 * 3) In cmd/terminal enter `firebase login` (and manually login to your google account in opened browser).
 * NOTE - you already have a `firebase.json` file, so you can skip `firebase init` step (should you prompt to do so).
 * 4) In cmd/terminal enter `firebase deploy`.
 * 5) check your public url (see 'Hosting Site' in previous command output).
